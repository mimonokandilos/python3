- Introduction to HTML and CSS
- Creating a simple static website using Flask (a Python web framework)


## website definition

index.html -> gives the schematic(skelatal outline of website)
styles.css -> gives the flavor of the website(how it looks?)


## TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT

1. python3 app.py 
 - to run the flask app, here we will see in the terminal a reflection of what it takes to run flask(ip:port and more details)
